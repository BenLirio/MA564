Reduce approx lattice to random linear equations with coeff in [ N ] of Zq

Group is [ N ] of Zq

draw pair of  group element and offset vector
Solution to group element 

average case SIS oracle

coefficients must be distributed almost uniformly at random in the group.


Previous approach
L in [ R x R ]
C is hypercude in [ R x R ]
partition C into [ Q << N ] parts
For each l in L find closest c in C
Let |c| be the number of l such that c is closest
|c| in C uniform => dist of C is uniform on L
|c - l| is short

Making |c| uniform and |c - l| short are contradictory requirements

Instead start from lattice point and add Guassian noise to it
Large enough noise so that the distribution is uniform

Pick random noise vector with Gaussian distribution and reduce it modulo
basis of the lattice.

Vector distributed almost uniformly at random over the fundamental parallelpiped.
Induce a uniform distribution over the parallelepiped.

Noise vector must be at least as large as smoothing param.


Lattice problems are NP-hard to approximate within small factors
construct one-way function on the assumption that P ne NP
lattice problem are hard for small factors
Large factors imply one-way function

We want an oracle for a one-way function to solve lattice problems
for small factors.
