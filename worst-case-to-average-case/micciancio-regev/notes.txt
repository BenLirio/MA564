SIS is at least as hard as approx lattice problems

SIS solver => approx Lattice solution

[ SVP SIVP Covering_Radius Guarenteed_Distance_Decoding ]

approx factor n log^O(1) n

No longer known to be in NP coNP

Tools: Gaussian & Fourier transform

Smoothing Param

Dist of noise given final value remains same
(Is this uniform?)

Worst case lattice => average-case one-way functions

f of [ M x N ] of Z_q
x of [ M ] of { 0 1 }
f x = [ M ] [ M x N ] of Z_q

B is the set of all n-linearly independent vectors in L [ N x N ]
SIVP finds a b in B such that |b| le |b'| for all other b' in B

approx-SIVP finds |b| such that 
  |b|  le  poly n |b'| 
for all other b' in B

approx-SIVP is similar to SVP


SIS is a one-way function if any of the following holds
- SIVP in O(n^2.5)
- SVP O(n^3)
- Covering Radius O(n^2.5)
- find lattice point within O(n^2.5) times covering radius of target
New constants
- SIVP O(n)
- SVP O(n)
- Covering radius O(n)
- BDD O(n)

O(n) for all lattice problems
