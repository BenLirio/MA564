N is dim
Q is modulo
B is basis [ N x N ]

P(B) is fundemental region

x <- Guass in [ N ]
v := x mod P(B)
a := B-inv v

M is large enough
A := B_inv V in [ N x M ]

x := SIS_oracle on A
x in [ M ]

  B_inv       V       x   is in Z
[ N x N ] [ N x M ] [ M ]

 Multiply both sides by B

    V       x   in B
[ N x M ] [ M ]

X <=> V mod P(B)

Therefore V in B

    X       x
[ N x M ] [ M ]


How short is |Xx| ?
